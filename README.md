# Best of Swiss Web 2010 - Lifetime Achievement Award 

In 2010 I was able to present the lifetime achievement award ("Ehrenpreis") to Robert Cailliau for 
his outstanding work creating and promoting the web in the early days.

I am absolutely convinced that without his push to license the web technology as public domain, 
the world would be very different today. 

In preparation for this presentation Robert has given me access to some historical photos, and reminded 
me that I should definitely not use a presentation tool like Powerpoint or Keynote and on the backdrop
of his engagement for standards and openness, I created the presentation in HTML, or XHTML to be more precise.

I found this deck on my drive recently, and thought that it is something that could be put on github for historical purposes.
